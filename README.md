# -Dataset-of-natural-images-with-Farsi-text-DNIFT-
 This is a dataset for evaluation Text detection algorithms that are designed to detect the Farsi text in natural images.
 The dataset includes natural images with Farsi and English texts. In the ground truths (GT) text areas are labeled by 
 white rectangles that specified text word by word.
 Each rectangle was converted into arrays X and Y, containing coordinates of polygon vertices stored as .mat Ô¨Åles, 
 similar to the data structure of standard datasets.
